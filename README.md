Problem statement

Setting: 1. the market starts with only one cashier line.
         2. the cost of opening a new cashier line gets more expensive as the number of the total cashier line increases
	 3. At first, with one cashier line, overflow happens and it is unsolvable due to the lack of resources.
	 4. Price and time are directly proportional, neglecting the grocery type.
	 5. Trolley at most can contain 10 products (whatever types)
	 6. Product types have no effect on process time
	 7. No extra customers one the number of customers has been confirmed
	 

Target: Try to make a simple game about queueing, making money, building your own cashier line system.
