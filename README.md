Problem statement

Setting: 1. the market starts with only one cashier line.
         2. the cost of opening a new cashier line gets more expensive as the number of the total cashier line increases
	 3. customers with a lot of products (e.g. require more than 7 minutes) will not be only queueing in only one specific line. i.e. they are averagely separated to all cashier line if cashier line>1.
	 4. At first, with one cashier line, overflow happens and it is unsolvable due to the lack of resources.
	 5. Price and time are directly proportional, neglecting the grocery type.
	 6. Trolley at most can contain 10 products
	 7. Product types have no effect on process time

Target: try to reduce all cashier waiting time to <15 minutes and maximise the profit by rearranging the customers' position, say, if one of the customers make the waiting time >15, move him/her to other cashier.
