problem statement

Setting: 1. the market starts with only one cashier line.
         2. the cost of opening a new cashier line get more expensive as the number of the total cashier line increases
	 3. customers with a lot of products (e.g. require more than 7 minutes) will not be only queueing in only one specific line. i.e. they are averagely separately to all cashier line if cashier line>1.
	 4. At first, with one cashier line, overflow happens and it is unsolvable due to the lack of resources.


Target: try to reduce all cashier waiting time to <15 minutes and maximise the profit by rearranging the customers' position, say, if one of the customers make the waiting time >15, move him/her to other cashier.
